        <h2 class="my-4 text-center font-serif text-3xl text-blue-600">Overview</h2>
        <div class="text-div">
            Inspired by the video game <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SimCity" target="_blank">SimCity</a> , in this project, we would like to build a
            virtual reality world where a user can design their own city. The user will play as a designer to place different buildings in a city, including
            parks, office buildings, schools, factories, hospitals, municipal buildings, and so on. Ideally, we would like to give the user the ability to
            design roads and streets as well as traffic lights. The city's layout will then be rated by the pedestrians in the city. The pedestrians will walk
            around the city, and their moods will change in response to the buildings they walk by. For example, if the office buildings are too clustered,
            pedestrians would probably feel bored. If the hospitals and police stations are too separate, pedestrians would probably feel unsafe.

        <h2 class="text-center font-serif text-2xl text-blue-500">Features</h2>

        <div class="text-div">
            <ul class="list-decimal">
                <li>
                    A 2D map builder that allows the user to manipulate a 2D map and a top-down view 3D city will generate and change correspondingly.
                    <ul class="ml-4 list-disc text-lg">
                        <li>We plan to accomplish most of this in Assignment #6 individually to gain more hands-on experience with aframe.</li>
                        <li>This feature will probably require a lot of 3D models.</li>
                        <li>
                            Ideally, buildings are instantiated with OOP. Each type of building is a separate class. Each type of building will have a different
                            effect on a pedestrian.
                        </li>
                        <li>The map will have a collision detector so that buildings cannot be too close to each other.</li>
                        <li>The user can remove a building from the map or clear the entire map</li>
                        <li>Optionally, there should be a button to save the map to the local storage.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Pedestrians will walk around to rate the city

                    <ul class="ml-4 list-disc text-lg">
                        <li>Some animated 3D models that can walk smoothly</li>
                        <li>Pedestrians should be able to search for a path to walk (To start, there will be only one road)</li>
                        <li>Dynamically display their rating based on the surrounding buildings</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                    A traffic system (two ideas for now):
                    <ul class="ml-4 list-disc text-lg">
                        <li>
                            There are a lot of driving cars in the city so the user has to design the positions of traffic lights to resolve the tradeoff
                            between the safety of pedestrians and the efficiency (speed) of the transportation
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            (When the user can design roads) Using some path-finding algorithms, the cars will find some road to go, providing more
                            interactions. e.g.A car might go over the speed when there are too few police stations, scaring the pedestrians
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <h2 class="my-4 text-center font-serif text-3xl text-blue-600">Update #1</h2>
        <div class="text-div">
            We have implemented the basic 2D map editor in 2D. In the “Edit” Mode, users could choose from different types of building models and place them on
            the map. The buildings are differentiated by their colors. Removing and collision detection are also implemented. They could further see the “city”
            they have already built from scratch by entering the “View” Mode, in which they are able to navigate in VR and experience the city of their own
            creation in 3D. User can also move to a building by clicking it.
        </div>

        <h2 class="text-center font-serif text-2xl text-blue-500">Some Thoughts</h2>

        <div class="text-div">
            We also plan to add rotation, but it is hard to display the UI to the user as the user cannot see which face the building it is. A model will
            possibly be added on the right of the panel to display the building so that the user can preview the building and rotate it.
        </div>

        <div class="text-div">
            We have small thoughts on bringing AR into the CIMS City, such that they are able to interact with current buildings in some way with fiducial
            markers. We are looking for a way to work with AR camera. Ideally, the camera is only open when the user wants to add something, and it will be
            turned off once the item is added.
        </div>

        <div class="text-div">
            Also, the current model with pedestrians may be difficult to increase its flexibility or adding motions and individual actions that could possibly
            be triggered if they are near certain types of building models etc. We are considering changing the pedestrians into cars (to make it easier by
            getting rid of animations), which would have less flexibility yet easier to implement and seem more neatly in the map.
        </div>
        <!-- <h2 class="text-center font-serif text-2xl text-blue-500">acknowledgement</h2> -->

        <hr class="sep-line" />
         <h2 class="my-4 text-center font-serif text-3xl text-blue-600">Update #2</h2>
        <div class="text-div">
            We have implemented the new version of background music for the game (inspired by the original soundtrack of SimCity 2000) to give the game a metropolitan vibe. Road elements are now available to be added as roads on the panel in editing mode, which would automatically be reflected as “bricks” on plane in the 3D mode. Ideally with further development, pedestrians are able to wander around the streets and are only allowed to walk on such restricted regions only.
        </div>

        <div class="text-div">
            The process of adding road bricks is similar to choosing building models on the edit panels. Roads objects are interpreted by the program as smaller planes on top of the massive grass playground we have for designers. 
        </div>

        <h2 class="text-center font-serif text-2xl text-blue-500">Small Problems</h2>

        <div class="text-div">
            It would be more convenient for designers if they could toggle around a specific region and pave the roads automatically over that selected area. Should I advance in this by increasing the width & height property for the road metadata so that every click reaches a wider scope, or should I try to change the default “paving-editing” process by changing the state of mouse cool down, so that the bricks would be paved when the designer is hovering over the map?
